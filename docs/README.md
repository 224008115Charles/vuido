## Introduction

Vuido makes it possible to create native desktop applications using Vue.js. It supports single-file components. Applications using Vuido can be run natively using Node.js on Windows, OS X and Linux, without using Electron.

Vuido uses the [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui) library which provides native GUI components for each desktop platform, and the [libui-node](https://github.com/parro-it/libui-node) bindings for Node.js. It works with Vue.js libraries such as Vuex and it's compatible with standard Node.js packages.

At the moment Vuido is in a very early stage of development. The first goal is to implement all controls currently supported by libui and to write a documentation.
