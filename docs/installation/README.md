# Installation

To use Vuido in your application, install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install --save vuido
```

This also installs and compiles libui-node, so make sure you have installed its [prerequisites](https://github.com/parro-it/libui-node/blob/master/readme.md#prerequisites).
